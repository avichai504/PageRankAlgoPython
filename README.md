## Overview

This project is a personal exploration into the PageRank algorithm, famously used by Google to rank web pages in their search engine results. I've implemented the algorithm in Python, focusing on understanding how web pages are ranked based on their interconnectedness. This is purely a fun and educational endeavor to dive deep into one of the most influential algorithms in the history of the internet.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: The implementation accepts the website graph in an adjacency list format, making it straightforward to represent the network of web pages and their links.

- **Two Versions of PageRank**: Includes the basic PageRank calculation and an enhanced version that incorporates a damping factor, which accounts for the likelihood of a user randomly jumping to a page rather than following links.

- **Visualization**: Utilizes a utility script to draw the graph, providing a visual understanding of the web page network and its link structure.
